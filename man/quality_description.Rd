\description{
A collection of functions to compute quality measures for
\code{\link{dimRedResult}} objects.

\section{Rank based criteria}{


The \code{Q_local}, \code{Q_global}, and \code{mean_R_nx} are
quality criteria based on the Co-ranking matrix.  \code{Q_local}
and \code{Q_global} determine the local/global quality of the
embedding, while \code{mean_R_nx} determines the quality of the
overall embedding. They are parameter free and return a single
number. The object must include the original data.  The number
returns is in the range [0,1], higher values mean a better
local/global embedding.
}

\section{Correlation based criteria}{


\code{total_correlation} calculates the sum of the mean squared
correlations of the original axes with the axes in reduced
dimensions, because some methods do not care about correlations
with axes, there is an option to rotate data in reduced space to
maximize this criterium. The number may be greater than one if more
dimensions are summed up.

\code{cophenetic_correlation} calculate the correlation between the
lower triangles of distance matrices, the correlation and distance
methods may be specified. The result is in range [-1, 1].

\code{distance_correlation} measures the independes of samples by
calculating the correlation of distances. For details see
\code{\link[energy]{dcor}}.

\section{Reconstruction error}{


\code{reconstruction_rmse} calculates the root mean squared error
of the reconstrucion. \code{object} requires an inverse function.
